          style="float: left" width="300" height="400"> Shadow of the Colossus is my ultimate all time favorite game ever. Its 
       combination of beautiful scenery,amazing story, stunning music, and fun gameplay
       has made it stand the test of time, not showing any of in the slightest. The game, for
       me and many others, has a large sense of awe-making nostalgia that over takes 
       the player the moment the first colossus stomps into view. With its up-coming
       remake its safe to say the game has and will always hold a special place in
       the hearts of many gamers. And it will always have a place at the top in my eyes.
