    <h1> 2. Ænima/Lateralus (fixed)</h1>
    
   <p class="solid" align="left"> <img src="TOOLdiv.jpg" style="float: left" width="500" height="500"> I honestly didn't know
     which to pick for this one. They are both just so equally good. I started with Ænima back in 2016. I bought the 
     CD totally oblivious to the sound of the music. I was awestruck the moment 'StinkFist' ended. It all felt
     like one song, and the moment it was over I played it again, I can't honestly count how many times I've played
     about that disc. The case certainly shows the wear and tare though. Lateralus was the second album from TOOL 
     that I listened too. And in it, they grabbed the bar they set with Ænima, and tore it off its foundation. That album,
     for me set the standard of what music can be. It opened the flood gates sort of speak. Lateralus was even the fist song
     I learned fully on the guitar. A utterly mind melting journey. So instead of wasting hours, days, months, years deciding
     on which to pick, I chose them together. Both equally amazing pieces of art!
