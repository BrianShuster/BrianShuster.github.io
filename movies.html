      Clocking in at just 2 Hours and 13 Minutes, this movie sits you down and straps you in from
      minute one. Full of Drama, Action, and interesting character developments, the movie is a 
      hit-and-run master piece. This movie has amazed me from the beginning, and not much has
      surpassed it yet. If you have yet to see this film, do so as soon as possible!
